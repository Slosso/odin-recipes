          Ingredients:
          <ul>
            <p>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin</p>
            <p>3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste</p>
            <p>1 quart oil for deep frying</p>
          </ul>

        <h3>
          Directions:
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>
              Transfer potato slices to a large bowl of cold water as you slice
              them.
            </p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>
              Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill the bowl with
              water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices back in the bowl.
              Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>
              Working in small batches, fry potato slices until golden. Remove
              with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Continue until all
              of the slices are fried.
            </p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>Season potato chips with additional salt if desired.</p>
          </ul>
