        <h2>Description: Great homemade pizza</h2>
        <h3>
          Ingredients:
          <ul>
            <p>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</p>
            <p>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</p>
            <p>2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
            <p>2 teaspoons white sugar</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>

          Directions:
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>
              Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until
              creamy, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>
              Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in
              a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has
              formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough
              doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>
              Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a
              round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite
              sauce and toppings
            </p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>
              Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust
              is golden brown, about 20 minutes
            </p>
          </ul>
